<p>You'll need to download and install Python (if you don't have it already) then install the botchallenge module.</p>

<h3>Python versions</h3>
<p>If you already have Python installed, check what version it is. To check the version, open IDLE
and the first thing it says is Python then the version number. If it's less than 3.4 then you'll
need to install the new version.</p>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install Python 3.4 from here.</a>
</p>

<h3>Installing the botchallenge module</h3>
<p>Open the Command Prompt, you can do using the search box in the Start Menu and searching for 'cmd' then clicking on either 'cmd.exe' or 'Command Prompt'.</p>
<p>When it's open type the following:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install botchallenge</code></pre>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As part of installing Python, you should have The IDLE Python editor installed. Open it up (you may need to search for it), create a new file (File &gt; New) and save it as mybot.py (you can call it what you like as long as it has .py on the end). Then type in (or copy-paste) the following:</p>

<pre><code>from botchallenge import *
</code></pre>

<p>The go to Run &gt; Run Module to run it (or hit F5).</p>
<p>If it prints nothing, congratulations! Everything is installed correctly.</p>
<p>If it shows an error, then there might have been a problem installing the modules or you might have more than one version of Python installed and you're using the wrong one, check that IDLE says Python 3.4 when it starts up.</p>

<p>If it's working, <a href="setup.html">connect to the server and get started</a>.</p>
